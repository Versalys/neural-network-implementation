# neural-network-implementation
An implementation of a MLP for CMU's machine learning for engineers class.

This NN can work with any problem, really, but the driver modules are for doing handwriting predictions
on the MNIST dataset. The neural network was tested on this dataset.

This implementation is fully vectorized, meaning it uses numpy matrix manipulation and algebra to obtain
performance increases that wouldn't be possible in, say, an implementation with more conventional
looping procedures.

To try it out, try fooling around with `main.py` a little bit :)
